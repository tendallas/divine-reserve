          <p>In a world where finding a 4-in-1 meal solution (delicious, convenient, affordable and healthy) seemed impossible, friends Shawn, Alex, German & Rihards came together with a common goalâ€”to create a company that would revolutionise the way we approach food and save the planet.</p>
          <p>Each of them had tasted the daily challenge of balancing deliciousness, convenience, affordability, and health in their meals. They realized that the best gift they could give themselves and their families is love and health. With unwavering determination, they founded the <span>525 Food Production Company in the EU and Paradigm Shift for Better Living company in the USA.</span></p>
          <p>The number &quot;525&quot; symbolised their commitment to utilizing every minute to make a positive impact: <strong>&quot;LOVE in ACTION&quot;</strong></p>
